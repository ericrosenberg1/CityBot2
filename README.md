# CityBot2

CityBot2 is a Python-based app designed to create social media postings for a local area, with the initial version featuring news source RSS feeds and government-sourced data on weather, and earthquakes. It supports postings to Bluesky, Facebook, LinkedIn, Reddit, and Twitter/X.

You can download it to your server and schedule it to run with customizations for your city. I'd love your help testing and improving!

This is a major upgrade and full rewrite of my original [CityBot](https://github.com/ericrosenberg1/CityBot).
